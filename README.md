Web development refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. While the terms "web developer" and "web designer" are often used synonymously, they do not mean the same thing.
There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.
